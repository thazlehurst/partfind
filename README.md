# partfind

Hi Hugh,

You need to create a conda enviroment called "partfind_dgl" then install the requirements (let me know if any are missing!).
I will email you a file you need to put in "trained_models" folder.
Then to run the program just open "partmatch_run.bat"

I can add the part look up function for you if you want, but you have to download the dataset, which is possible, but it is around 1GB, hence why its not in the github!

Let me know if you have any issues!

Tom
